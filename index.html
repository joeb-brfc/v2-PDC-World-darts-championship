                <h2 class="card-title">Founding of the PDC</h2>
                <p>
                  The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) was founded in 1992
                  by a group of leading players who broke away from the British
                  Darts Organisation (BDO). The sport had been struggling during
                  the late 1980s and early 1990s due to declining TV coverage,
                  sponsorship, and media interest. Sixteen top players—including
                  Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, John Lowe, Dennis Priestley, and
                  Bob Anderson—formed the World Darts Council (WDC), which later
                  became the PDC. Their aim was to modernize the sport, secure
                  better promotion, and restore darts to its former glory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The split from the BDO led to a bitter and lengthy legal
                  battle over tournament names, TV rights, and player
                  eligibility. Players who joined the new organization were
                  banned from BDO events, and there was considerable tension
                  between the two bodies. However, the WDC (renamed PDC in 1997)
                  gradually built its reputation through better televised
                  events, higher prize money, and more professional
                  organization. By the early 2000s, the PDC had firmly
                  established itself as the premier professional darts body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Key pioneers like Phil Taylor, often regarded as the greatest
                  darts player of all time, helped build the credibility of the
                  PDC with dominant performances and global appeal. Barry Hearn,
                  who became chairman of the PDC in 2001, played a pivotal role
                  in transforming darts into a commercially successful sport
                  through smart marketing and global expansion. Today, the PDC
                  stands as a testament to the vision and risks taken by its
                  founding players, who revolutionized the modern game.

                  Growth of the World Darts Championship
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The World Darts Championship has seen explosive growth in
                  popularity over the past two decades, driven by engaging
                  broadcasts, entertaining personalities, and a festival-like
                  atmosphere at Alexandra Palace. Broadcasters like Sky Sports
                  and global streaming platforms have brought darts into
                  millions of homes, helping the sport transcend its pub roots
                  and reach international audiences. Events now attract fans
                  from around the world, with themed costumes, lively crowds,
                  and viral moments making darts a standout in the winter sports
                  calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As viewership has surged, so too has the prize money. In the
                  early 2000s, the PDC World Championship offered a fraction of
                  today's payouts. Fast forward to recent years, and the prize
                  fund now exceeds £2.5 million, with the world champion taking
                  home £500,000. Sponsorship deals, increased ticket sales, and
                  international broadcasting rights have all contributed to this
                  financial boost, making darts a lucrative career path for top
                  players and raising the stakes of competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking ahead, the continued expansion of the sport into new
                  markets—particularly in North America, Asia, and mainland
                  Europe—suggests even greater potential for growth. As the PDC
                  invests in youth development, women’s tournaments, and global
                  tours, prize funds could increase further, possibly surpassing
                  £3 million in the near future. With its unique blend of
                  tradition, drama, and spectacle, the World Darts Championship
                  seems poised to keep drawing bigger crowds, higher stakes, and
                  global attention.

                  Women in Darts & Diversity in the PDC
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Women’s participation in professional darts has grown
                  significantly in recent years, with pioneers like Fallon
                  Sherrock and Lisa Ashton leading the way. Sherrock made
                  history at the 2019 PDC World Darts Championship by becoming
                  the first woman to win a match, defeating both Ted Evetts and
                  Mensur Suljović. Lisa Ashton followed with another
                  breakthrough, becoming the first woman to earn a PDC Tour Card
                  via Q School in 2020, allowing her to compete regularly
                  against male professionals. These milestones helped shatter
                  outdated perceptions and brought widespread attention to the
                  potential of women in the sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To support this momentum, the PDC launched the Women’s Series
                  in 2020, providing regular tournaments, prize money, and
                  direct qualification routes to the World Championship for the
                  top female players. As a result, women now have two dedicated
                  spots in the PDC World Championship each year, and figures
                  like Beau Greaves—WDF World Champion and rising star—are
                  showcasing elite-level skill with averages that rival top male
                  players.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The increased visibility of women’s darts has also been
                  boosted by growing media coverage and sponsorship. Players
                  like Sherrock have become highly marketable, and fans have
                  embraced more inclusive and mixed-gender competitions.
                  Cultural shifts within the sport have led to broader
                  acceptance and opportunities, not only on the oche but also in
                  roles like commentary and officiating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While challenges remain—such as the disparity in prize money
                  and fewer women advancing deep into major open tournaments—the
                  direction is promising. With improved grassroots support and
                  competitive structures, women’s darts is evolving rapidly, and
                  it’s increasingly likely we’ll see female players making
                  deeper runs in the biggest events of the sport.

                <p>
                  The Alexandra Palace, known affectionately as "Ally Pally,"
                  has been the iconic home of the PDC World Darts Championship
                  since 2008. Every December, the venue comes alive with a
                  raucous and colorful crowd, making it one of the most electric
                  atmospheres in global sport. Prior to its move to Alexandra
                  Palace, the Championship was held at the more intimate Circus
                  Tavern in Purfleet from 1994 to 2007. While the Tavern played
                  host to many historic moments, including several of Phil
                  Taylor’s world titles, the sport’s rising popularity called
                  for a grander stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alexandra Palace is steeped in history and culture. Located in
                  North London, it was originally opened in 1873 as a “People’s
                  Palace” for public recreation and education but tragically
                  burned down just 16 days later. It was quickly rebuilt and
                  reopened in 1875. The palace is surrounded by nearly 200 acres
                  of parkland and is renowned for its panoramic views over the
                  capital. Over the decades, it has hosted everything from
                  concerts and exhibitions to sporting events and public
                  festivals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of Alexandra Palace's most significant contributions to
                  history was serving as the site of the BBC’s first public
                  television broadcast in 1936, making it a landmark in
                  broadcasting. Today, it stands as both a cultural hub and a
                  major sporting venue. Its transformation each winter into the
                  spiritual home of darts has cemented its legacy in modern
                  sports culture, where tradition and spectacle meet under one
                  historic roof.
